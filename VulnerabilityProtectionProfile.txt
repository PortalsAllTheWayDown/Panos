This uses rules to control how certain network based attacks are handled.
ACTION contains the same options as Anti-Spyware: allow, drop, alert, reset-client,reset-server,reset-both,and block-ip

The reset actions send TCP RST packets.

block-ip blocks all packets coming from a source and can be set to monitor source to block everything or a source destination, to only block packets to a specific destination for an amount of time.

Host Type helps determine whether the rule applies to a threat directed at a client(download - for example a browser vulnerability), server(upload - for example an SQL injection), or "any".
