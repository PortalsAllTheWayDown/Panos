Secure Shell(SSH) is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network.

SSH allows tunneling, which can be used to subvert firewalls and breach security policies.

SSH tunneling, also known as SSH port forwarding, is how SSH tunnels network traffic through applicaiton ports from the localhost -- the computer physically present -- to a remote system or vice versa.

If hackers gain access to a host running SSH on an organizations internal network they can use ssh on that host as a secure pipeline for exploiting private network services.
