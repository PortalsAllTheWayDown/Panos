A VR is the routing element of the firewall. Each layer 3, loopback, and VLAN interface needs to be associated with a VR, but multiple VRs can be used on a system. Not all interfaces need to be associated with the same VR.
The virtual routers are found in the network tab under virtual routers.
By default static routes have a higher priority than OSPF(Open Shortest Path First), but you can change this priority if you want OSPF routes to have priority and only use static routes if OSPF becomes unavailable.
You can also adjust the priority of a route if it has the same routing protocol.

You may need to setup a default route to the internet which the destination of this route would be 0.0.0.0/0

Next hop has serveral options:
    -IP Address: The IP of the upstream router to forward packets to.
    -Next VR: Whether the packet needs to handed over to a different VR on the same device.
    -FQDN: If the upstream router has a dynamic IP, it could be useful to use an FQDN that is dynamically updated by a DNS record.
    -Discard: Routes can be set to "black hole" certain subnets. This can be used to prevent any packets from reaching a connected out of band network, even if a security policy were to allow this.
    -None: Routes may not have a next hop, such as packets routed into a VPN tunnel.
